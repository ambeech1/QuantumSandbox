# QuantumSandbox
A desktop application made with PyQt6 for learning about quantum mechanics through visual methods.

## Master
Contains Python code files and UI files for the main application.

## Numerical Python Experimentation
This repo contains the Python files used to test the numerical methods being used to solve the TISE/TDSE in the application.

## Old CXX Code
I originally began writing this project in C++. I decided to switch to Python, but my old C++ code is included in this branch.
EIGEN LIBRARY SHOULD BE ADDED
